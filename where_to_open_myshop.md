# Introduction
## Background
Indian food is growing stronger in all over world. Indian restaurants are very often crowded especially in Dallas,USA area.

This project aims to estimate the best localization to open such a business in Dallas city . which have many colleges, museums, and a modern metropolis in north Texas

Prior launching any restaurant, itâ€™s important to know if the business as a good opportunity. In order to do so, this report will try to gather data about other restaurant localization, competitors and best localization.

These data could be use for a business plan afterward

## Problem 
As the goal of this is to create a business plan in the end, we need to make sure data from api are correct. We also need to check that customer could be interested in this specific business.

Maybe they will need to modify some data.

why restaurant: 
N=in recent days many people from India a re moving to state and 68% among them live in Dallas, so keeping the demand for Indian food as a key parameter ,I initiated this project

Data 
This notebook is highly inspirated by the template given in the course. I will keep the idea of clustering the city by area and then plot heatmap to find better area.

I will change some data:

Country/City: Dallas
Goal: Open a restaurant for  workers in weekdays
So, I will cross data from working days, and localisations.

I will use the following API:

Foursquare API: to find restaurant/venues
Google API: reverse geolocalisation
